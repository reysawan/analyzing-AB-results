# Analyzing AB Test Results in E-Commerce
In this project, the performance of a client's new e-commerce page was analyzed and then compared to the performance of the original page. Three tools were used to investiate the new page's success (or lack thereof): 1) probability testing, where we looked at the different outcomes of the two pages; 2) A/B testing, where we compared our observed scores to a random sample; and 3) logistic regression analysis, where we investigated trends and introduced new exploratory variables.
